            <p id="func1" class="demo">Another name of a yoke is the frame. The main function of the yoke in the machine is to offer mechanical support intended for poles and protects the entire machine from moisture, dust, etc. The materials used in the yoke are designed with cast iron, cast steel otherwise rolled steel.</p>

            <p id="func2" class="demo">The pole of the DC machine is an electromagnet and the field winding is winding among pole. Whenever field winding is energized then the pole gives magnetic flux. The materials used for this are cast steel, cast iron otherwise pole core. It can be built with the annealed steel laminations for reducing the power drop because of the eddy currents.</p>

            <p id="func3" class="demo">Pole shoe in the DC machine is an extensive part as well as to enlarge the region of the pole. Because of this region, flux can be spread out within the air-gap as well as extra flux can be passed through the air space toward armature. The materials used to build pole shoe is cast iron otherwise cast steed, and also used annealed steel lamination to reduce the loss of power because of eddy currents.</p>

            <p id="func5" class="demo">Armature core includes a huge number of slots within its edge. The armature conductor is located in these slots. It provides the low-reluctance path toward the flux generated with field winding. The materials used in this core are permeability low-reluctance materials like iron otherwise cast. The lamination is used to decrease the loss because of the eddy current.

            <button onclick="content('func6')" value="0">Function ⬇️ </button>
            <p id="func6" class="demo">The armature winding can be formed by interconnecting the armature conductor. Whenever an armature winding is turned with the help of prime mover then the voltage, as well as magnetic flux, gets induced within it. This winding is allied to an exterior circuit. The materials used for this winding are conducting material like copper.

            <p id="func7" class="demo">The main function of the commutator in the DC machine is to collect the current from the armature conductor as well as supplies the current to the load using brushes. And also provides uni-directional torque for DC-motor. The commutator can be built with a huge number of segments in the edge form of hard drawn copper. The Segments in the commutator are protected from the thin mica layer.
