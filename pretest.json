        "a": "According to ohm's law, the current is directly proportional to potential difference.  <a href='www.google.com'>here</a>",
        "b": "It violates ohm's law",
        "c": "Option b violates ohm's law ",
        "d": "Current is invrsely proportional to resistance and resistance directly proportional to temperature because as the temperature increases, resistivity increases and resistance also increases. "

      "question": "3. The armature torque of the DC shunt motor is proportional to ",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Field flux only ",
        "b": "Armature current only ",
        "c": "Field flux and armature current ",
        "d": "Field current"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": " Field flux is constant in DC shunt motors. <a href='www.google.com'>here</a>",
        "b": "for dc machine, torque is directly proportional to armature current and flux. In dc shunt motors, flux is constant. Hence torque is directly proportional to armature current.",
        "c": "Field flux is constant in DC shunt motors therefore only depends on armature current.",
        "d": "In DC shunt motors , the armature torque does not depend on field current. "
