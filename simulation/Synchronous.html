            <p id="func3" class="demo">Slots are cut on the inner periphery of the stator core in which 3 phase or 1 phase winding is placed. Enameled copper is used as a winding material. The winding is star-connected. The winding of each phase is distributed over several slots. When the current flows in a distributed winding it produces an essentially sinusoidal space distribution of EMF.

            <button onclick="content('func4')" value="0">Function ⬇️</button>
            <p id="func4" class="demo">The term salient means projecting. Thus, a salient pole rotor consists of poles projecting out from the surface of the rotor core.
                Since the rotor is subjected to changing magnetic fields, it is made of steel laminations to reduce eddy current losses. Poles of identical dimensions are assembled by stacking laminations to the required length. A salient pole synchronous machine has a non-uniform air gap. The air gap is minimized under the pole centers and it is maximum in between the poles.

            <p id="func5" class="demo">Armature core includes a huge number of slots within its edge. The armature conductor is located in these slots. It provides the low-reluctance path toward the flux generated with field winding. The materials used in this core are permeability low-reluctance materials like iron otherwise cast. The lamination is used to decrease the loss because of the eddy current.
