#### 4. Simulator Interactions:
<br>

Sr.No | What Students will do? |	What Simulator will do?	| Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:--:
1.|  Students can see three types of machines.  | Simulator will show three types of machines with the name. | To see the parts of a machine.  
2.|  Students can click on DC machine to see the parts of DC machine. | Simulator will show the parts of DC machine with the names and their functions. | To see the parts of DC machine and understand the function of its parts.
3.|  Students can now click on asynchronous machine.  |  Simulator will show two machines (Single phase induction machine and Three phase induction machine). | To see the parts of selected machine and understand their functions.
4.|  Students can now click on the synchronous machine.  |  Simulator will show the parts of synchronous machine with their names and their functions. | To see the parts of synchronous machine and understand their functions.
